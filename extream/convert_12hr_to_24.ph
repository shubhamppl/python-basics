"""time.split(":")[0]: time is the input time string in the format "hh:mm AM/PM". The split(":") function splits the string at the colon character ":", creating a list of two elements. The [0] index selects the first element of the list, which corresponds to the hour value before the colon. This value is assigned to the variable hours.

time.split(":")[1][:2]: Similar to the previous step, the split(":") function creates a list of two elements, but this time the [1] index selects the second element of the list, which corresponds to the minutes value after the colon. The [:2] slice notation selects the first two characters of this value, which corresponds to the minutes value. This value is assigned to the variable minutes.

time.split(" ")[1]: The split(" ") function splits the input time string at the space character " ", creating a list of two elements. The [1] index selects the second element of the list, which corresponds to the AM/PM value after the time. This value is assigned to the variable am_pm.

Overall, the code extracts the hour, minutes, and AM/PM values from the input time string and assigns them to the hours, minutes, and am_pm variables, respectively.



Sure, let's take the following string as an example: time = "02:30 PM".

Now let's break down the code line by line:

time.split(":")[0] - This will split the string time by :, and return a list of two elements ['02', '30 PM']. The [0] index will return the first element which is the hours in 12-hour format. So, hours will be equal to '02'.

time.split(":")[1][:2] - This will split the string time by :, and return a list of two elements ['02', '30 PM']. The [1] index will return the second element which is minutes followed by AM/PM. Then [:2] will return only the first two characters of this element which are the minutes. So, minutes will be equal to '30'.

time.split(" ")[1] - This will split the string time by space, and return a list of two elements ['02:30', 'PM']. The [1] index will return the second element which is either "AM" or "PM". So, am_pm will be equal to "PM".

"""
time = input("Enter time in 12-hour format (hh:mm AM/PM): ")

# Extract hours, minutes and AM/PM from the input time
hours, minutes, am_pm = time.split(":")[0], time.split(":")[1][:2], time.split(" ")[1]

# Convert hours to int and adjust for 12-hour format
hours = int(hours) % 12
if am_pm == "PM":
    hours += 12

# Format the time in 24-hour format
time_24hr = f"{hours:02}:{minutes}"

print(f"Time in 24-hour format: {time_24hr}")
